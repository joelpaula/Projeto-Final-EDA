To check the results, have a look at the [Jupyter Notebook](Projeto-Final-92478_93259_93392.ipynb).

We made this work by [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) around one of our computers for several hours a day, in a period of about 3 weeks. 
We used Visual Studio Code as our editor and also [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) on those brief periods when we needed to work solo on different stuff (refactoring code, polishing the structure, adding details to our text). At the same time, one of us was keeping a copy in GitHub, just as a safety measure.

We got a (very!) good grade with this work, but we might have done better:
- We should have made a conclusion to end the work, but we were already tired when we reached that stage üòÅ;
- Using Jupyter notebooks is not really appropriate for a work this size. We started using it for the first part (it still made sense) as it provides a user interface for trying out stuff. Also, we had some odeas of making it more interactive. In the end the Jupyter notebook format just gaves an headache (wouldn't export into PDF in any of our machines, and the CoCalc export was really bad) and we couldn't really acomplish our idealized user interface.We should have reverted to using a Word document, like normal people;
- The data sources we used for the second part are not that good, hence the poor map results, if you are familiar with the London underground. Sorry for that - we didn't have the time to fix it and they were being provided at meere hours from the delivery term.
